# Blackhole

> Blackhole is a simple file upload and download service, similar to Dropbox. The name comes from the fact that it's a black hole for your files: upload once and you can delete it off your local machine! We do the heavy lifting for you. Easily share files with your friends and family.

## Installation

1. Create a Python3 virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Important Notes

Hi there! We are wanting to get Blackhole deployed ASAP so our team can start uploading files. We hired a contractor off of Fiverr to build it, and this is what they delivered. Could you please take a look and let us know if you can find any vulnerabilities? We'd really appreciate it! The last thing we need is for someone to hack into our system and retrieve all of our sensitive mission critical files.

Thanks for your help!
